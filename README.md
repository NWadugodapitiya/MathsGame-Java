# MathsGame-Java
I developed a Java GUI-based Maths Game designed to enhance the mathematical knowledge of children from 1st to 5th grade. The game features a points systemâ€”adding points for correct answers and deducting for incorrect onesâ€”making learning interactive and fun. ðŸš€ðŸŽ® 


1. **Project Title:** Interactive Maths Game for Kids
2. **Description:** A Java GUI-based educational game for children in grades 1-5 to improve their mathematical skills.
3. **Create a README.md file** with the following details:
   - 
   - 
   - **Features:**
     - Multiple grade levels (1-5)
     - Points system (adds points for correct answers, deducts for wrong answers)
     - Simple and engaging UI
   - **Technologies Used:** Java, Swing (or JavaFX if applicable)
   - **How to Run:** Steps to compile and execute the game
   - **Screenshots:** Add the images you shared to showcase the UI
   - **Future Improvements:** Optional section for planned enhancements
   - **Contributors:** Your name and GitHub profile link

### **LinkedIn Post:**
1. Write a post explaining why you built the project.
2. Mention how it helps kids in grades 1-5 improve their math skills.
3. Highlight the features (grade selection, points system, interactive UI).
4. Add screenshots (the ones you provided).
5. Share the GitHub repository link so others can check it out or contribute.

Would you like me to help draft the GitHub `README.md` and the LinkedIn post content for you?
